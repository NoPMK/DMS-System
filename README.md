# DMS Manager

**Overview:**
DMS Manager is an innovative Windows-based file management application designed for enhanced usability and efficiency. Built using C++ with COM objects and WinForms, this program offers a robust alternative to traditional file explorers with its dual-panel interface inspired by Total Commander. Its advanced features, such as drag-and-drop capabilities, collapsible side panels, structured tree views, and a dynamic output window, make it an essential tool for sophisticated file management.

**Key Features:**

Dual-Panel Layout:
Inspired by the renowned Total Commander interface, DualPanel Explorer features a two-pane layout, enabling users to manage files across different directories simultaneously.
Each panel operates independently, allowing for multi-tasking without switching windows.

Drag and Drop Functionality:
Intuitive drag-and-drop interactions facilitate easy file and folder operations. Users can move or copy items between panels or within the same panel, streamlining file organization.

Collapsible Side-Panels with Structured Tree:
Each panel includes a collapsible side-panel that displays a structured directory tree. This feature aids users in navigating complex folder hierarchies efficiently.
The side panels can be expanded or collapsed with a simple click, providing more space for file browsing when needed.

Customizable Output Window with Colored Text:
The output window at the bottom of the interface displays logs, operation statuses, and other critical information in real-time.
Text coloring differentiates various types of information — errors, warnings, and general logs—enhancing readability and user response to events.

**Technical Specifications:**

Development Environment: C++ with COM objects for seamless integration and performance optimization in Windows environments.
User Interface: Developed using WinForms, known for its ability to create visually appealing and responsive GUIs.
Extensibility: The architecture allows for easy integration of additional modules and plugins, offering customization options to meet diverse user needs.

DMS Manager is more than just a file manager; it is a comprehensive tool designed to cater to the needs of power users who require efficient and effective file management solutions. Its user-friendly interface, coupled with powerful features like the structured tree view and color-coded output window, ensures an optimal user experience. Whether for personal use or professional environments, DMS Manager stands out as a superior choice for managing files on Windows platforms.
